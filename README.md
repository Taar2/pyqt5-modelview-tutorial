This is an attempt at rewriting each example found at [/openwebos/qt/tree/master/examples/tutorials/modelview](https://github.com/openwebos/qt/tree/master/examples/tutorials/modelview) as a single Python3/PyQt5 file.

The examples work with Python 3.6.3, Qt 5.9.1 and PyQt5 5.9 on Windows.

The `__main__` code is tweaked to work well from Spyder.

For the accompanying official tutorial about Qt Model/View programming, see [there](http://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/modelview.html).
